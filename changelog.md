### 28 Changelog ref 28
- Fixed bug that caused catgory list to contain an empty ```<option>``` and null

### 27 Changelog ref 27
- Options generated by ```populateDropdown()``` now have value attributes based off their index in their array
    - By accessing the value attribute, you can chain it onto its category/type/brand array to access either the spaced or the underscored name
- Updated ```populatedDropdown()``` to take the array of arrays provided by ```createArrayOfValuesStoredInKey()``` instead of just one of the array
    - This way it can directly access the array of underscored names instead of underscoring the values passed to it

- all/any functionality implemented!

### 22 Changelog ref 22
- When product.price is 0 or null, the price element states "price unlisted"

    - Split price into two elements, one for the sign and one for the number
    - Edited dispay properties and added more line breaks
- Changed default dropdowns to say "loading..." while loading and "select" afterward

### 21 Changelog ref 21

    - Not sure why

### 20 Changelog ref 20
- Text introducing tags now states "Show products that are tagged with all of the following"
    - "all" may be clicked on to change it to "any", which communicates the intent of the filtration to the script
    - "all" changes color and the cursor type when hovered over to emphasize its interactability

### 19 Changelog ref 19
- Added code that sets ```checkedTags``` to an array of the checked elements' values as opposed to the elements themselves
- Filters ```filteredProducts``` by each tag in ```checkedTags```

### 18 Changelog ref 18

- Added for loop that creates cells for each product in ```filteredProducts```
- Gives all elements of a cell a matching class value so that one element may be used to identify its product

### 16 Changelog ref 16
- Deprecated ```filterByKeyValue()``` because ```buildCell()``` now takes product objects, an array of which can be produced by using ```.filter()``` on ```allProducts```
- Implemented if statements that detect which filters are active, and then apply them

### 15 Changelog ref 15
- Updated price formatting to account for numbers with digits in the 10s place and higher

### 14 Changelog ref 14
- Updated ```buildCell()``` function to take a product object and id instead of an index to be retrieved

### 13 Changelog ref 13
- Changed method of filtering functionality
    - Previously planned on invoking each element of an array of filtration functions using a for block
    - Previous plan didn't mesh well with ```buildCell()``` function, which builds a cell based on its index value in ```allProducts``` (running ```.filter()``` on ```allProducts``` would return an array of the objects, themselves, not their ids)
    - Created new function ```filterByKeyValue()``` that returns an array of indexes at which there is an object that has a key value pair that matches the key and value arguments provided to the function

### 12 Changelog ref 12
- Site now loads first 10 cells upon loading completion

### 11 Changelog ref 11
- Randomize button changed to Apply Filter
- Test keydown event removed

### 9 Changelog ref 9
